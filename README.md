It's a Joy! In Elixir.

This serves as a simple, experimental version (or multiple thereof) of the [Joy]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_(programming_language) ) programming language.

Purpose of this is to explore how simple yet productive a programming language can be made.

**Simple** means in this context:

- easy to parse and analyse, easy to write or **generate**
- easy to extend, i.e. easy to improve from within the language itself

**Productive** means in this context:

- high-level, i.e.supporting arbitrary abstractions
- fast, i.e. supporting arbitrary implementation goals
- independent yet extensible, i.e. containing a possibility to interop with existing solutions

An informal goal of this is to create a language that is both easy for machines to target, yet still understandable and usable by humans.
The first aspect is important since the overall goal of kallisto is to provide an environment where programming is more efficient by means of extensive tooling.
The second aspect answers the question of whether to leave programming completely up to machines or not.
